Hello, Monty. or (everyone)
Nice to meet you.

Thank you for having a technical interview with me.

Through this interview, I sincerely hope that by sharing each other's technic knowledges and abilities, So we will build mutual trust and take our skills to the next level.

Thanks

Let me introduce myself about my experience of Defi Protocol development.

I have been involved in some large Blockchain Defi protocol development.

In that companies, I have been a Backend developer and Blockchain Smart contract developer. 

In thoes days, I get rich experiences of Development of Defi Protocol and also I improved a lot of majoring skills.

Over the past few years I have been involved in large projects such as ratio.finance, visor.finance and Hubbleprotocol.

In the meantime, I have also participated in the development of stablecoins such as USDH in HubbleProtocol.

So, before answering your technical questions, let me talk about some of the innovative technologies used to develop USDH stable coin.

Are you ok ?

Hubble’s native token, HBB, is backed by tokenomics designed to capture value for our DeFi community.

That native stablecoin maintains its peg via open source arbitrage and redemption bots along with deep protocol-owned liquidity.

Hubble will operate as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a community-supported governance model. 

Hubble rewards users who stake HBB with 85% of the revenue generated from fees accrued by the platform.

Liquidations are democratized so anyone can generate revenue for themselves through maintaining the health of Hubble by depositing USDH in our Stability Pool.

When staking USDH in the Stability Pool, you will earn HBB as reward on top of liquidation gains.

Hubble is based on 6 collateral types, such aas SOL, ETH, BTC, FTT, RAY, SRM as collateral.

Holders of these assets can lock their holdings and issue the stablecoin USDH, which they can use to invest, spend, or stake somewhere else to earn more yield.

So Here is the end of my introduction. So Please ask me questions.

Yeah, At that time, That project was changed to onsite development postion from remote development postion.
So I had to move to where the company was located.
However, due to problem of my family, I was unable to move so I had to migrate all the things to the next developer of that company.
Yes that is reason.


What are the essentials for doing a great job? 

What are the biggest challenges? 

It is important to me that I quickly get into my area of responsibility. Will there be someone who will familiarize me with everything and show me everything in the first few weeks?  

- Can you talk about company culture? 

- What is the greatest challenge facing the company? 

- What are the company's goals for the upcoming year? 






1. What are Bitcoin Blockchain and Ethereum Blockchain: Note the differences.

	Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have immutable records stored in decentralized, distributed databases. 
	As an alternative digital currency, Bitcoin provides many benefits. 
	In contrast, one can recognize Ethereum as the king of smart contracts, permitting peer-to-peer contracts and applications through its currency known as ETH. 
	Hence, the design of Ethereum was to work alongside bitcoin rather than as a substitute for bitcoin.

2. In what ways does Blockchain differ from conventional databases? 
	
	While conventional databases have a central ledger, blockchain technology has a distributed ledger, implying it does not have a solo server. 
	Due to its complete transparency, which is unlikely in a centralized ledger, it is a very reliable technology.

3. What is and how is double-spending prevented?
	
	It’s the act of re-transacting a particular cryptocurrency’s balance more than once. 
	Furthermore, one can accomplish this by tricking the network into believing that the initial amount is never spent, making it accessible for repeated transactions.

4. In your opinion, which blockchain technology is the best: Private or Consortium?
	
	Each type of Blockchain has distinct characteristics, applications, and needs; however, a private blockchain is an all-in-one solution for building your corporate blockchain network. 
	Also, organizations looking to expedite communication with each other would need a consortium blockchain, on the other hand.

5. How are ICOs and IPOs different?
	
	There is a fundamental distinction between an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and an Initial Public Offering (IPO). 
	Both have a different way of issuing. 
	It takes a long time and a lot of effort to calculate the market value of each share in an IPO. In addition, while an IPO requires attorneys, banks, and a lot of patience, an ICO, 
	one requires programmers and a good Internet connection.
	
6. Can you name a handful of the most popular development platforms for blockchain applications?
	
	Hyperledger Fabric, Ripple, Ethereum, R3 Cords, and Quorum are some of the leading Blockchain-based app development platforms. 
	Blockchain developers must consider factors like scalability, type, popularity, etc., before choosing any one of these platforms.

7. Is there anything you’ve heard about the Lightning Network?
	
	The lightning network is an off-chain micropayment mechanism that speeds up the Blockchain’s transaction processing time. 
	Furthermore, members of the lightning network may engage in countless microtransactions with each other without requiring the miners to provide anything in return. 
	Then the system uploads an entire transaction set to the blockchain after the locking of the payment channel. Here, one can instantly make the transactions without relying on miners. 
	In addition to allowing for micropayments and multi-signature transactions, the network’s decentralization eases the strain on the main chain and speeds up transaction times.

8. Determine if something is fungible or non-fungible.

	When one can trade an equivalent token for any other token of the same kind if it is fungible, one cannot use non-fungible things interchangeably. 
	As a result, non-fungible tokens are not convertible with fungible tokens, as they cannot substitute for each other.

9. Explain the meaning of the Blockchain wallet.

	A blockchain wallet is an electronic or virtual wallet. 
	We can digitally store, transfer, and manage cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many others using a blockchain wallet.

10. Demonstrate how DeFi works.

	DeFi platform’s autonomy enables cross-border payments to be made more cheaply and quickly. It is an efficient way to trade.

11. What are the prerequisites for establishing a blockchain technology in business usage?

	For starters, here are a few:
		When it is a peer-to-peer network.
		If the system is able to run decentralized apps using smart contracts.
		It can keep data indefinitely without risking the integrity of the security measures.
		When it’s possible to store data in a distributed fashion.
		Strong protection of the privacy of user data.
		Immutability ensured.
		
12. What is mining on the blockchain?

	The practice of verifying a blockchain’s transactions by the miners without the involvement of a third party is known as “blockchain mining.” 
	Also, the transaction pool receives every transaction submitted from a crypto wallet. 
	Moreover, to create a block, miners choose hundreds of transactions and combine them with additional overheads like Merkel Root, SHA-256 Hash, Nonce, etc.

13. List a few of the most useful tools for building a blockchain.
	
	Truffle Framework, Solidity, Remix, Geth, and Meta Mask
	
14. In your opinion, what are some of the most pressing issues in the adoption and scalability of blockchain technology?
		
	Interoperability.
	Expenditure of Resources.
	Standardization is lacking, and there is not enough talent.
	
15. What are Blockchain’s drawbacks?
	
	It’s a challenging technology to learn and apply because of its complexity. 
	Furthermore, another difficulty with Blockchain technology is scalability. 
	Plus, network speed and transaction costs can vary, and there’s always a chance of human error.
	
16. In Blockchain, can a block (or blocks) be removed from a network?
	
	No, we cannot manually remove a block. 
	However, one may use default settings and filters to eliminate blocks. 
	Therefore it is possible to re-download deleted blocks whenever necessary.
	
17. What are some of the most important aspects of the technology of Blockchain?
	
	Transparency, immutability, security, and transaction fee reduction are some of the most important aspects of Blockchain technology.
	
18. Write about several kinds of consensus algorithms in your answer.

	Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
	Proof-of-Work (PoW)
	Proof-of-Authority (PoA)
	Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)
	Byzantine Fault Tolerance
	Proof-of-Elapsed Time (PoET)
	
19. Describe how the PoW consensus works.
	
	For PoW consensus, speed and accuracy are the most important considerations while attempting to evaluate difficult mathematical problems. 
	Here, miners compete by doing faster computations to find a particular block’s hash. 
	The first miner to find the solution gets the reward in the form of crypto coins.	
	
20. Explain the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) concept.
	
	The PoS mechanism verifies each block before the network can add another block to the blockchain ledger. 
	In contrast to PoW, in PoS, miners may participate in the mining process by staking their coins. 
	Therefore, it requires only a few hardware and software resources for users to mine. 
	Also, the more coins a miner has, the higher their chances are to dominate the consensus, which means that only the wealthiest can have control of the consensus.
	
21. What is the definition of CBDC?
	
	CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency, which is backed by national credit and government authority and is directly managed by the country’s central bank. 
	Hence, one can store and use CBDC as a digital version of central bank money to make electronic payments.
	
22. Describe the DeFi technology.

	In the context of financial services, decentralized finance refers to the use of smart contracts and distributed ledger 
	technology (Blockchain technology) to eliminate the need for a central authority to oversee the transactions.
	
23. What is the meaning of Hyperledger Fabric?
	
	As a distributed ledger platform, Hyperledger Fabric offers scalability, flexibility, and performance designed to meet the company’s needs. 
	Moreover, this Enterprise-grade DLT blockchain developer platform is flexible and versatile for a wide range of industrial use cases, 
	such as banking, healthcare, supply chain, and human resources.	
	
24. Smart Contracts: What Are They? 
	
	The term “smart contract” refers to computer code that enables the exchange of value, whether monetary, in the form of content, shares, or anything else. 
	Plus, smart contracts are self-executing computer programs that execute a transaction when certain criteria are satisfied.
	
25. What are dApps, and how are they different from other types of mobile apps? 
	
	DApps operate on a P2P network of computers rather than a single computer. Popular, inventive, and feature-rich dApps include Cipher and Chainlink.
	
26. Describe the function of Blockchain technology in governance.

	Decentralization, integrity, and openness are just some of the advantages of blockchains in governance that make them more popular. 
	Therefore, blockchain distributed networks may help governments run more effectively and develop more confidence among 
	their populations by boosting transparency and expediting the revenue collecting process. 
	However, it would be possible with a skilled blockchain expert team in place.
	
27. List a few blockchain-related misconceptions that need to be dispelled.
	
	The Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are the same.
	There is no such thing as a private blockchain.
	Currently, technology solely focuses on financial services.
	A database is all that the blockchain is.
	Using the blockchain platform is completely free and open source.
	
28. Are there any limitations on record types while using Blockchain?
	
	It’s not like that at all. 
	Depending on your needs, you can keep any kind of record. 
	Records of transaction processing, business transactions, identity management, health management data, and other critical paperwork are the most often recorded types of data in the blockchain. 
	In addition, blockchain technology may also store other types of data.

29. Is Blockchain a secure method of doing business?
	
	Blockchain technology is unquestionably a safe and tamper-proof technology that facilitates sharing of important data between participants.

30. Do you have any predictions for the future of Blockchain? 
	
	Blockchain technology has the potential to open up whole new avenues for economic exchange and make a significant contribution to the growth of the global economy. 
	As long as widespread acceptance isn’t reached for the blockchain degree, the way firms function and the IT sector’s environment will alter irrevocably. 
	With the increasing adoption of blockchain-based services, demand for blockchain engineer professionals may rise globally.
	
31.Differentiate between Blockchain and Hyperledger.
	
	Blockchain is a decentralized technology of immutable records called blocks, which are secured using cryptography. Hyperledger is a platform or an organization that allows people to build private Blockchain.

	Using Blockchain you can build public and private Blockchain whereas with Hyperledger you can only build private Blockchains.

	Blockchain is divided into public, private, and consortium Blockchains and Hyperledger is a private Blockchain technology with access to Blockchain data and is limited to predefined users, configurations, and programming.

	Blockchain can be used in multiple fields such as business, government, healthcare, etc. while Hyperledger is primarily used for enterprise-based solutions. Wherever we talk about public Blockchain, it refers to the usage of Blockchain on the internet, and Hyperledger-based Blockchain solutions are solutions meant for usage on the intranet, within an organization.

32. How do you explain Blockchain technology to someone who doesn't know it?
	
	Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger, which stores transaction details in the form of immutable records or non-modifiable records (called blocks) which are secured using cryptography.

	Let’s consider the example of a school where Blockchain is similar to a digital report card of a student. 
	Say, each block contains a student record that has a label (stating the date and time) of when the record was entered. 
	Neither the teacher nor the student will be able to modify the details of that block or the record of report cards. 
	Also, the teacher owns a private key that allows him/her to make new records and the student owns a public key that allows him to view and access the report card at any time. 
	So basically, the teacher owns the right to update the record while the student only has the right to view the record. This method makes the data secure.

33. What is Merkel Tree?
	
	Merkel Tree is a data structure that is used for verifying a block. 
	It is in the form of a binary tree containing cryptographic hashes of each block. 
	A Merkle tree is structured similarly to a binary tree where each leaf node is a hash of a block of transactional data and each non-leaf node is a hash of its leaf node. 
	The Merkel root or hash root is the final hash root of all the transaction hashes. It encompasses all the transactions that are underlying all the non-leaf nodes.

34. What do you mean by blocks in Blockchain technology?
	
	Blockchain is a distributed database of immutable records called blocks, which are secured using cryptography. 
	Refer to the video to see the various attributes of a block.

	There are a previous hash, transaction details, nonce, and target hash value. 
	A block is like a record of the transaction. 
	Each time a block is verified, it gets recorded in chronological order in the main Blockchain. 
	Once the data is recorded, it cannot be modified.

35. How is Blockchain distributed ledger different from a traditional ledger?
	
	A Blockchain distributed ledger is highly transparent as compared to a traditional ledger.
	Blockchain distributed ledgers are irreversible. Information registered on a distributed ledger cannot be modified whereas on a traditional ledger it is reversible.
	A distributed ledger is more secure. It uses cryptography and every transaction is hashed and recorded whereas in traditional ledger security can be compromised.
	In a distributed ledger, there is no central authority. It is a distributed system and the participants hold the authority to maintain the sanity of the network and are responsible for validating the transactions. Traditional ledgers are based on the concept of centralized control, which controls all transactions.
	In a distributed ledger, identities are unknown and hidden whereas in traditional ledger identities of all participants have to be known before the transactions happen.
	In a distributed ledger, there is no single point of failure as the data is distributed and information is shared across multiple nodes. If one node fails, the other nodes carry the same copy of the information. In comparison, traditional ledgers have a single point of failure. If a single system crashes, the entire network comes to a standstill.
	In a distributed ledger, data modification or change cannot be done but for a traditional ledger, it is possible.
	In a distributed ledger, validation is done by the participants in the network while in a traditional ledger, validation is done by a centralized authority.
	The copy of the ledger is shared amongst participants in a distributed ledger while in a traditional ledger, a single copy is maintained in a centralized location. It is not shared amongst the participants.

36. How can you identify a block?

	Every block consists of four fields -
		
		The hash value of the previous block (thereby getting linked in a blockchain)
		It contains details of several transaction data
		It has a value called the nonce. The nonce is a random value which is used to vary the value of the hash in order to generate hash value less than the target
		Hash of the block itself. It is the digital signature of the block and an alphanumeric value used to identify a block
	The hash address is the unique identification of the block. It is a hex value of 64 characters that have both letters and digits. It is obtained by using the SHA - 256 algorithms.

	Refer to the video to see how a block is structured. The hash of the previous block, transaction data, and the nonce consolidate the header of the block. They are together passed through a hashing function and then the hash value is generated.
	
37. What is cryptography? What is its role in Blockchain?
		
	Blockchain uses cryptography to secure users’ identities and ensure transactions are done safely with a hash function.

	Cryptography uses public and private keys in order to encrypt and decrypt data. In the Blockchain network, a public key can be shared with all the Bitcoin users but a private key (just like a password) is kept secret with the users.

	Blockchain uses SHA - 256 which is secure and provides a unique hash output for every input. The basic feature of this algorithm is whatever input you pass, it will give you a standard alphanumeric output of 64 characters. It is a one-way function from which you can derive an encrypted value from the input, but not vice-versa.

38. What are the different types of Blockchain?

	There are three different types of Blockchain - Public, Private, and Consortium Blockchain.

	Public Blockchain ledgers are visible to all the users on the internet and any user can verify and add a block of transactions to the Blockchain. Examples, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.

	Private Blockchain ledgers are visible to users on the internet but only specific users in the organization can verify and add transactions. It’s a permissioned blockchain, although the information is available publicly, the controllers of the information are within the organization and are predetermined. Example, Blockstack.

	In Consortium Blockchain, the consensus process is controlled by only specific nodes. However, ledgers are visible to all participants in the consortium Blockchain. Example, Ripple.
	
39. What happens when you try to deploy a file with multiple contracts?

	In Blockchain, deploying a file with multiple contracts is not possible. The compiler only deploys the last contract from the uploaded file and the remaining contracts are neglected.

40. What is a Genesis Block?
	
	The genesis block is the first block in the Blockchain which is also known as block 0
	In Blockchain, it is the only block that doesn’t refer to its previous block.
	It defines the parameters of the Blockchain such as,
		level of difficulty,
		consensus mechanism etc. to mine blocks

41. How is the hash (Block signature) generated?
	
	The process of generating a block signature involves:

	Passing transaction details through a one-way hash function i.e., SHA-256.
	Running the output value through a signature algorithm (like ECDSA) with the user’s private key.
	Following these steps, the encrypted hash, along with other information (such as the hashing algorithm), is called the digital signature.

42. List down some of the extensively used cryptographic algorithms.
	
	Here are a few popular algorithms:

	SHA - 256
	RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
	Triple DES
	Ethash
	Blowfish
	
43. What is a smart contract and list some of its applications?

	Smart contracts are self-executing contracts which contain the terms and conditions of an agreement between the peers

	Some of the applications are:

	Transportations: Shipment of goods can be easily tracked using smart contracts

	Protecting copyrighted content: Smart contracts can protect ownership rights such as music or books

	Insurance: Smart contracts can identify false claims and prevent forgeries

	Employment contract: Smart contracts can be helpful to facilitate wage payments


44. What is the Ethereum network and how many Ethereum networks are you familiar with?

	Ethereum is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality that enables users to create and deploy their decentralized applications

	There are three types of networks in Ethereum:

		Live network (main network) - Smart contracts are deployed on the main network
		Test network (like Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby) - Allow users to run their smart contracts with no fees before deploying it on the main network  
		Private network - Are those which are not connected to the main network. They run within the premises of the organization but carry the features of an Ethereum network.

45. Where do nodes run a smart contract code?
	
	Nodes run smart contracts code on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is a virtual machine designed to operate as a runtime environment for Ethereum-based smart contracts.

	EVM is operated in a sandboxed environment (isolated from the main network). This is a perfect testing environment.

	You can download the EVM, run your smart contract locally in an isolated manner and once you have tested and verified it, you can deploy it on the main network.

46. What is a Dapp and how is it different from a normal application? 


	Dapp:

		A Dapp is a decentralized application which is deployed using smart contract
		A Dapp has its back-end code (smart contract) which runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network
	Process:
		Front-end
		Smart contract (backend code)
		Blockchain (P2P contract)
	
	Normal application:
		Normal application has a back-end code which runs on a centralized server
		It’s a computer software application that is hosted on a central server
	Process:
		Front-end
		API
		Database (runs on the server)

47. Name some leading open source platforms for developing Blockchain applications.

	Ethereum is one of the popular platforms for building Blockchain-based applications
	Eris is used for building enterprise-based solutions
	Some of the other widely used platforms for building Blockchain include Hyperledger, Multichain, Open chain.


48. What is the very first thing you must specify in a Solidity file?
	
	It is necessary to specify the version number of Solidity at the beginning of code as it eliminates incompatibility errors that can arise while compiling with another version. This is a mandatory clause that has to be there at the top of any Solidity code you write. You also need to mention the correct version number for the code.


49. What is the nonce and how is it used in mining?

	In Blockchain, mining is a process to validate transactions by solving a difficult mathematical puzzle called proof of work. 
	Now, proof of work is the process to determine a number (nonce) along with a cryptographic hash algorithm to produce a hash value lower than a predefined target. 
	The nonce is a random value that is used to vary the value of hash so that the final hash value meets the hash conditions.

50. Name the steps that are involved in the Blockchain project implementation.
	
	Requirement identification:

		Identify the problem and goal
		Identify the most suitable consensus mechanism
		Identify the most suitable platform
		Account for implementation and deployment costs
	Planning stage

		In this stage and individual evaluates all requirements and decides a suitable blockchain platform to be implemented.
	Development and implementation of a project

		Designing the architecture
		Designing the user interface
		Building the APIs
	Controlling and monitoring the project

		Applying Proof of Concept (POC)
		Identifying and fixing issues
51. Explain a real-life use-case where Blockchain is being used.
	
	In supply chain management, smart contracts provide permanent transparency and validation of transactions shared by multiple supply chain partners. 
	Check out our diagrammatic display of supply chain management using Blockchain in our video.

52.  List and explain the parts of EVM memory.

	The memory of an EVM is divided into three types:

	Storage:

		Storage values are stored permanently on the Blockchain network
		It is extremely expensive
	Memory:

		Memory is a temporary modifiable storage
		It can be accessed only during contract execution. Once the execution is finished, its data is lost
	Stack:

		A stack is temporary and non-modifiable storage.
		Here, when the execution completes, the content is lost.
		
53. What happens if the execution of a smart contract costs more than the specified gas?

	Initially, your transaction will be executed, but if the execution of a smart contract costs more than the specified gas, then the miners will stop validating your contract. 
	The Blockchain will record the transaction as failed, also the user doesn’t get a refund.

54. What does the gas usage in a transaction depend on and how is the transaction fee calculated?
	
	Gas usage depends upon the amount of storage and set of instructions (codes) used in a smart contract. 
	The transaction fee is calculated in Ether, which is given as:

55.  What is the fork? What are some of the types of forking?
	
	In simple terms, updating a cryptocurrency protocol or code is called forking. 
	Fork implies that a Blockchain splits into two branches. 
	It can happen when the participants of the network cannot come to an agreement with regards to the consensus algorithm and new rules to validate transactions.
	
	There are three types of forking:

		Hard forks
		Soft forks
		Accidental fork
56. Differentiate between Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake.

	Proof of Work (PoW):

		In Blockchain, PoW is the process of solving a complex mathematical puzzle called mining. Here, the probability of mining a block is based upon the amount of computational work done by a miner. Miners spend a lot of computing power (with hardware) for solving the cryptographic puzzle.

	Proof of Stake (PoS):

		PoS is an alternative to PoW in which the Blockchain aims to achieve distributed consensus. The probability of validating a block relies upon the number of tokens you own. The more tokens you have, the more chances you get to validate a block. It was created as a solution to minimize the use of expensive resources spent in mining.

57. What is a 51% attack?
	
	In Blockchain, a 51% attack refers to a vulnerability where an individual or group of people controls the majority of the mining power (hash rate). 
	This allows attackers to prevent new transactions from being confirmed. Further, they can double-spend the coins. 
	In a 51% attack, smaller cryptocurrencies are being attacked.

58. What are function modifiers in Solidity? Mention the most widely used modifiers.

	In Solidity, function modifiers are used to easily modify the behavior of your smart contract functions. In simple terms, it can build additional features or apply restrictions on the function of smart contracts. The most extensively used function modifiers in solidity are: 

	View, which are functions that cannot modify the state of a smart contract. They are read-only functions. Refer to our video to see an example of a View function
	Pure, which are functions that neither read nor write the state of a smart contract. They return the same result determined by its input values. Refer to our video to see an example of a Pure function
